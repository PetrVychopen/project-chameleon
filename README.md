# Project Chameleon

This Python script helps you adapt JSON data from one format (JSON 1) to another format (JSON 2), making it compatible with different systems.

## Context
Are you migrating data from an old web service that uses JSON 1 to a new one that uses JSON 2?
Project Chameleon can streamline the process by restructuring your JSON 1 data to match the format expected by JSON 2.
This script is particularly useful for comparing prices or other data points between the two systems.

## Features

- Parses JSON 1 data.
- Restructures data to match JSON 2 format.
- Maintains relevant data points during conversion.
